# Algorithmic Trading Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an algorithmic trading assignment completed for CleverBharat's Algorithmic Trading Internship. The project includes stock data analysis, strategy development, and risk management using Python.

## Tasks Completed
### Task 1: Stock Data Analysis
- Fetched historical stock data for five stocks from the Nifty 50 index using the `yfinance` library.
- Calculated the daily percentage change for each stock.
- Plotted the closing prices and daily percentage changes for the five stocks.
- Calculated and plotted the 20-day moving average for each stock.

### Task 2: Strategy Development
- Developed a simple moving average crossover strategy using a short-term moving average (50-day) and a long-term moving average (200-day).
- Backtested the strategy on historical data to identify buy and sell signals.
- Compared the returns generated by the strategy to a simple buy-and-hold approach.

### Task 3: Risk Management
- Calculated the maximum drawdown for each stock over the 6-month period.
- Implemented a stop-loss mechanism (5%) for the selected stock from Task 2 and compared its performance with the original strategy.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `yfinance`, `matplotlib`

## How to Run the Code
